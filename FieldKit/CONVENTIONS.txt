	FieldKit
	- conventions used in this library

	* All positionable objects extend Vec3
	  e.g. Particle, Emitter, Sphere etc.
	  
	* += and -= operators are always used for adding/ removing an object to 
	  a group e.g. ArrayBuffer, Branch, Flock
	  When they're not available e.g. since the class already uses them for 
	  other purposes then revert back to add and remove method names
	  
	* multiple constructors should be avoided and replaced with the class -  
	  companion object pattern whereever possible
